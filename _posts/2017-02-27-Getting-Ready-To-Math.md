Ever notice this: before performing some small calculation, whether it's in a magazine, or blog post, those following are warned "we're going to have to work out the math"...

\\[u_t = \Delta\nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\nabla u}{\lvert \nabla u \rvert}\right) - \lambda_D(u-f), \\]

$$ \mathsf{Data = PCs} \times \mathsf{Loadings}, $$

\\[ \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{P^\mathsf{T}}, \\] 

\\[ \frac{u^{n+1} - u^n}{\Delta t} = -p\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{h^2} + p\frac{u_{i+1}^{n+1} - 2u_i^{n+1} + u_{i-1}^{n+1}}{h^2} + f^n + g^{n+1}, \\]

\\[\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} - \mu(1-x^2) \frac{dx}{dt} + x = 0, \\]

\\[x^{n+1} = x^n - \frac{f(x^n)}{f'(x^n)}, \\]

\\[\operatorname{argmin} \int_\Omega \lvert \nabla u \rvert \,dx + \lambda\int_{\Omega \setminus D} (f-u)^2 \,dx \\]

$$\dots$$ and even more formulas if the situation calls for it. 

(I'm having some trouble with the argmin call up there. If I give it a subscript, then later subscripts break the expression and the outputs fails to display properly. Does not seem to be a problem inline, $$\operatorname{argmin}_u \int_\Omega g dx$$, or with no more subscripts following.)

A series of posts are expected involving math.
